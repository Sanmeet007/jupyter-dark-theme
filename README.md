## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter
- Chrome browser ( recommended v100.0 or above )

## Installation

#### Custom CSS Theme

You can directly invoke the CSS inside a notebook like this:

```python
from IPython.core.display import HTML, display
from urllib.request import urlopen

CSS_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sanmeet007/jupyter-dark-theme/main/dist/custom.css"
CSS = urlopen(CSS_URL)
CSS = CSS.read().decode('utf-8')
HTML_CSS = f"""
<style>
{CSS}
</style>
"""
HTML(HTML_CSS)
```

> Note : You will need to run that every time you start a notebook. See below for a more permanent installation

---

For a permanent installation, we first need to copy `custom.css` file to `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css`.

#### Using windows cmd and explorer

First we need to generate the config for the jupyter notebook.After this we need to paste our `custom.css` file to `~/.jupyter/custom/`.

```bash
jupyter notebook --generate-config
cd .jupyter
mkdir custom # may already exist
explorer .
```

Now paste the downloaded `custom.css` file here in this file location `~/.jupyter/custom/`

#### Checking if css was installed correctly

```
jupyter notebook
```

> Note : Here the `~` denotes the path before the .jpuyter folder.

#### Using bash only

```bash
cd ~/.jupyter
mkdir custom  # may already exist
cd .jupyter/custom
rm custom.css
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sanmeet007/jupyter-dark-theme/main/dist/custom.css
```

## Printing

As recommended use the lastest chrome browser . For printing use the `Ctrl + P` command .

> Note : The print preview doesn't shows the exact printing because of custom css applied
